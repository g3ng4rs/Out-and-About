## ⭐ Inspiration !
* Out and About's inspiration was the lack of accesibility in many locations and the necessity for an easy to access map that will show various places to what the accommodations the user requests and inclusive requirements ♿

## ⚙️ What it does
* The website welcomes users with specified services and resources. It has checkboxes so the users can select multiple services to find near them and then locations with those services can be chosen from the drop down menu 🗺️📌
