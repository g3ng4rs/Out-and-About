## ⭐ Inspiration !
* Out and About's inspiration was the lack of accesibility in many locations and the necessity for an easy to access map that will show various places to what the accommodations the user requests and inclusive requirements ♿

## ⚙️ What it does
* The website welcomes users with specified services and resources. It has checkboxes so the users can select multiple services to find near them and then locations with those services can be chosen from the drop down menu 🗺️📌

## ⌨️ How we built it
* Out and About was built using Figma, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and etc.

## 🤔 Challenges we ran into
* Compiling and debugging issues, attempted to make a decision tree but used different methods instead

## 🥇 Accomplishments that we're proud of
* The ability to find a different way to make a decision tree since the data was complex

## 💗 What we learned
* Expanded our knowledge of different programs and especially learned what types of services people require and are not easy to find simply by searching on the web at points

## ✏️ What's next for Out and About
* Expanding from the exclusively the Atlanta area into all of Georgia then possibly the United States
